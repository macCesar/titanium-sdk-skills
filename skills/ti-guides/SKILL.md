# Titanium SDK guide expert

Use this skill to keep Titanium projects aligned with TiDev standards for stability, performance, and cross-platform behavior.

## Project detection

:::info Auto-detects Titanium projects
This skill auto-detects Titanium projects. No manual command is needed.

Titanium project indicator:
- `tiapp.xml` file (definitive indicator)

Applies to both:
- Alloy projects (`app/` folder)
- Classic projects (`Resources/` folder)

Behavior:
- If a Titanium project is detected, provide official Titanium SDK guidance, memory management best practices, and app distribution help.
- If not detected, say this skill is only for Titanium projects.
:::

## Core workflow

1. Validate the project follows a modular pattern (CommonJS or Alloy).
2. Ensure global listeners are removed and heavy objects are nulled during cleanup.
3. Cache frequently accessed native properties to reduce bridge crossings.
4. Use Hyperloop for specialized native functionality and handle casting and threading correctly.
5. Use transactions for database work and manage image memory footprints.

## Procedural rules

- Always remove `Ti.App` and `Ti.Geolocation` listeners during controller cleanup.
- Do not access `Ti.Platform` or `Ti.DisplayCaps` inside loops. Store values in local variables.
- Concatenate Hyperloop selectors accurately (for example, `addAttribute:value:range:` -> `addAttributeValueRange`).
- Close resultsets and database handles after every transaction block.
